# Frontend

Go to my-app folder and install deps then run the application.

```
npm install
npm start
```

# backend 
```
docker-compose build 
docker-compose up
```

When the backend application is ran, a seed code will be executed to load the database with initial data from the public api.


## Why I worked for more than 2 hours 

External and out of hands factors cause this delay but I tried my best to make a functional code.
